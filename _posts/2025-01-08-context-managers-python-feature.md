For years, I wrote Python like this:

```python
def process_data_file(filename):
    f = open(filename, 'r')
    data = f.read()
    f.close()
    return parse_data(data)
```

It worked. Until it didn't. 

A bug in `parse_data()` would leave files open. Network hiccups during database operations left connections hanging. Temporary directories stuck around after exceptions.

Then I discovered context managers weren't just for files.

## The "with" statement revelation

Everyone learns `with open()` eventually:

```python
def process_data_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        data = f.read()
    return parse_data(data)
```

But I thought that was it. Files and maybe database connections. I didn't realize the pattern could solve much bigger problems.

The breakthrough came when I was working on a data pipeline that needed to:
1. Download files from S3
2. Process them locally
3. Clean up temporary files
4. Update a database with results

The naive approach was a maintenance nightmare:

```python
def process_s3_batch(file_keys):
    temp_dir = None
    connection = None
    try:
        temp_dir = create_temp_directory()
        connection = get_db_connection()
        
        for key in file_keys:
            local_file = download_from_s3(key, temp_dir)
            result = process_file(local_file)
            save_result(connection, result)
            
    finally:
        if temp_dir:
            cleanup_directory(temp_dir)
        if connection:
            connection.close()
```

Ugly. Error-prone. Hard to test.

## Custom context managers to the rescue

I learned that any class with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods is a context manager:

```python
class TempDirectory:
    def __init__(self, prefix="temp_"):
        self.prefix = prefix
        self.path = None
        
    def __enter__(self):
        self.path = tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix=self.prefix)
        return self.path
        
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if self.path and os.path.exists(self.path):
            shutil.rmtree(self.path)
        return False  # Don't suppress exceptions

# Now the code becomes:
def process_s3_batch(file_keys):
    with TempDirectory() as temp_dir:
        with get_db_connection() as connection:
            for key in file_keys:
                local_file = download_from_s3(key, temp_dir)
                result = process_file(local_file)
                save_result(connection, result)
```

Clean. Reliable. Readable.

## The contextlib shortcut

Writing `__enter__` and `__exit__` gets verbose. The `contextlib` module provides shortcuts:

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager
import time

@contextmanager
def timer(description):
    start = time.time()
    print(f"Starting {description}")
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        elapsed = time.time() - start
        print(f"{description} completed in {elapsed:.2f}s")

# Usage:
with timer("data processing"):
    process_large_dataset()
```

The `yield` statement is where your code runs. Everything before `yield` is the setup (`__enter__`). Everything after is the cleanup (`__exit__`).

## Real-world context managers I use daily

**Database transactions:**

```python
@contextmanager
def transaction(connection):
    transaction = connection.begin()
    try:
        yield connection
        transaction.commit()
    except Exception:
        transaction.rollback()
        raise

with transaction(db_connection) as conn:
    update_user(conn, user_id, new_data)
    log_update(conn, user_id, timestamp)
    # Either both succeed or both rollback
```

**API rate limiting:**

```python
@contextmanager
def rate_limited_api():
    wait_time = rate_limiter.get_wait_time()
    if wait_time > 0:
        time.sleep(wait_time)
    
    try:
        yield api_client
    finally:
        rate_limiter.record_request()

with rate_limited_api() as api:
    result = api.fetch_data()
```

**Configuration switching:**

```python
@contextmanager
def temporary_config(**overrides):
    old_values = {}
    for key, new_value in overrides.items():
        old_values[key] = config.get(key)
        config.set(key, new_value)
    
    try:
        yield config
    finally:
        for key, old_value in old_values.items():
            if old_value is None:
                config.unset(key)
            else:
                config.set(key, old_value)

# Test with different settings
with temporary_config(debug=True, log_level="DEBUG"):
    run_test_suite()
```

## When to use context managers

Context managers shine when you have:

- **Setup and teardown patterns**: Open/close, connect/disconnect, acquire/release
- **Temporary state changes**: Config overrides, directory changes, environment variables
- **Resource management**: Memory, file handles, network connections
- **Exception safety**: Ensuring cleanup happens even when things go wrong

They're not just about files and databases. Any time you find yourself writing try/finally blocks, consider a context manager instead.

## The mindset shift

Context managers changed how I approach resource management. Instead of remembering to clean up, I make cleanup automatic.

Instead of hoping exceptions don't break my cleanup logic, I guarantee it with `__exit__`.

Instead of scattered setup and teardown code, I encapsulate the entire lifecycle in one place.

The `with` statement isn't just syntax sugarâ€”it's a design pattern that makes Python code more reliable and easier to reason about.

Start looking for setup/teardown patterns in your code. You'll be surprised how many places context managers can simplify your life.
