# Resource Management Made Elegant

One of Python's most underappreciated features is the context manager protocol and the `with` statement. This powerful mechanism ensures proper resource management, making your code more robust and preventing common bugs like memory leaks and unclosed files.

## The Problem with Manual Resource Management

Before diving into context managers, let's look at why they're necessary:

```python
# Problematic code - what if an exception occurs?
def process_file_unsafe(filename):
    file = open(filename, 'r')
    data = file.read()
    # If an exception occurs here, the file never gets closed!
    result = expensive_processing(data)
    file.close()  # This might never execute
    return result

# Better, but verbose
def process_file_verbose(filename):
    file = None
    try:
        file = open(filename, 'r')
        data = file.read()
        result = expensive_processing(data)
        return result
    finally:
        if file:
            file.close()
```

## Enter the `with` Statement

The `with` statement solves this elegantly:

```python
# Clean and safe
def process_file_clean(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
        result = expensive_processing(data)
        return result
    # File is automatically closed, even if an exception occurs
```

## How Context Managers Work

Context managers implement two special methods:
- `__enter__()`: Called when entering the `with` block
- `__exit__()`: Called when exiting the `with` block (even on exceptions)

```python
class SimpleContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering the context")
        return self
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Exiting the context")
        if exc_type:
            print(f"An exception occurred: {exc_value}")
        return False  # Don't suppress exceptions

# Usage
with SimpleContextManager() as cm:
    print("Inside the context")
    # raise ValueError("Something went wrong")  # Uncomment to see exception handling
```

## Built-in Context Managers

### File Operations

```python
# Reading files
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()

# Writing files
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")

# Multiple files
with open('input.txt', 'r') as infile, open('output.txt', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(infile.read().upper())
```

### Threading Locks

```python
import threading

lock = threading.Lock()

# Manual lock management (prone to deadlocks)
def unsafe_operation():
    lock.acquire()
    try:
        # Critical section
        shared_resource += 1
    finally:
        lock.release()

# Safe lock management with context manager
def safe_operation():
    with lock:
        # Critical section
        shared_resource += 1
```

### Database Connections

```python
import sqlite3

# Automatic transaction management
with sqlite3.connect('database.db') as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)", 
                   ("Alice", "alice@example.com"))
    # Transaction is automatically committed
    # Connection is automatically closed on exception
```

## Creating Custom Context Managers

### Class-Based Context Managers

```python
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self, host, port, database):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port
        self.database = database
        self.connection = None
    
    def __enter__(self):
        print(f"Connecting to {self.host}:{self.port}/{self.database}")
        # Simulate database connection
        self.connection = f"Connected to {self.database}"
        return self.connection
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Closing database connection")
        if exc_type:
            print("Rolling back transaction due to error")
        else:
            print("Committing transaction")
        self.connection = None
        return False

# Usage
with DatabaseConnection("localhost", 5432, "mydb") as conn:
    print(f"Using connection: {conn}")
    # Database operations here
```

### Timer Context Manager

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, description="Operation"):
        self.description = description
        self.start_time = None
    
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        print(f"Starting {self.description}")
        return self
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        elapsed = time.time() - self.start_time
        print(f"{self.description} took {elapsed:.4f} seconds")
        if exc_type:
            print(f"Failed with {exc_type.__name__}: {exc_value}")
        return False

# Usage
with Timer("Data processing"):
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate work
    # Process data here
```

## The `contextlib` Module

Python's `contextlib` module provides utilities for creating context managers more easily.

### `@contextmanager` Decorator

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def file_manager(filename, mode):
    print(f"Opening {filename}")
    file = open(filename, mode)
    try:
        yield file
    finally:
        print(f"Closing {filename}")
        file.close()

# Usage
with file_manager('test.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write("Hello from context manager!")
```

### Temporary Directory Management

```python
import tempfile
import shutil
from contextlib import contextmanager
import os

@contextmanager
def temporary_directory():
    """Create a temporary directory and clean it up when done."""
    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    try:
        yield temp_dir
    finally:
        shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)

# Usage
with temporary_directory() as temp_dir:
    # Create temporary files
    temp_file = os.path.join(temp_dir, 'temp.txt')
    with open(temp_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write("Temporary data")
    
    print(f"Temp directory: {temp_dir}")
    print(f"Files: {os.listdir(temp_dir)}")
# Directory is automatically cleaned up
```

### Suppressing Exceptions

```python
from contextlib import suppress

# Instead of try/except for expected exceptions
with suppress(FileNotFoundError):
    os.remove('nonexistent_file.txt')

# Equivalent to:
try:
    os.remove('nonexistent_file.txt')
except FileNotFoundError:
    pass
```

### Redirecting Output

```python
from contextlib import redirect_stdout, redirect_stderr
import io

# Capture print output
output_buffer = io.StringIO()
with redirect_stdout(output_buffer):
    print("This goes to the buffer")
    print("So does this")

captured_output = output_buffer.getvalue()
print(f"Captured: {captured_output}")
```

## Advanced Context Manager Patterns

### Nested Context Managers

```python
from contextlib import ExitStack

def process_multiple_files(filenames):
    with ExitStack() as stack:
        files = [stack.enter_context(open(fname, 'r')) for fname in filenames]
        
        # All files are now open and will be closed automatically
        for file in files:
            content = file.read()
            # Process content
```

### Context Manager with Configuration

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager
import logging

@contextmanager
def log_level(level):
    """Temporarily change logging level."""
    logger = logging.getLogger()
    old_level = logger.level
    logger.setLevel(level)
    try:
        yield logger
    finally:
        logger.setLevel(old_level)

# Usage
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)
print("Current level allows warnings")

with log_level(logging.DEBUG):
    logging.debug("This debug message will be shown")
    logging.info("This info message will be shown")

logging.debug("This debug message will NOT be shown")
```

### Resource Pool Manager

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager
import queue
import threading

class ConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self, max_connections=5):
        self.pool = queue.Queue(maxsize=max_connections)
        # Initialize pool with mock connections
        for i in range(max_connections):
            self.pool.put(f"Connection-{i}")
    
    @contextmanager
    def get_connection(self):
        connection = self.pool.get()
        try:
            yield connection
        finally:
            self.pool.put(connection)

# Usage
pool = ConnectionPool(3)

with pool.get_connection() as conn:
    print(f"Using {conn}")
    # Use connection for database operations
```

## Real-World Examples

### API Client with Automatic Authentication

```python
import requests
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def authenticated_session(api_key):
    """Create an authenticated requests session."""
    session = requests.Session()
    session.headers.update({'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'})
    
    try:
        # Test authentication
        response = session.get('https://api.example.com/auth/test')
        response.raise_for_status()
        yield session
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
        raise
    finally:
        session.close()

# Usage
with authenticated_session('your-api-key') as session:
    response = session.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    data = response.json()
```

### Configuration Context

```python
@contextmanager
def config_override(**kwargs):
    """Temporarily override configuration values."""
    import config  # Your config module
    
    original_values = {}
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        if hasattr(config, key):
            original_values[key] = getattr(config, key)
        setattr(config, key, value)
    
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        # Restore original values
        for key, value in original_values.items():
            setattr(config, key, value)

# Usage
with config_override(DEBUG=True, MAX_CONNECTIONS=10):
    # Code runs with overridden config
    run_debug_operations()
# Original config is restored
```

### Performance Monitoring

```python
import time
import psutil
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def monitor_performance(operation_name):
    """Monitor CPU and memory usage during an operation."""
    process = psutil.Process()
    start_time = time.time()
    start_memory = process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024  # MB
    start_cpu = process.cpu_percent()
    
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        end_time = time.time()
        end_memory = process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024  # MB
        end_cpu = process.cpu_percent()
        
        print(f"Performance Report for {operation_name}:")
        print(f"  Duration: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
        print(f"  Memory usage: {end_memory - start_memory:.2f} MB")
        print(f"  CPU usage: {end_cpu:.1f}%")

# Usage
with monitor_performance("Data Processing"):
    # Perform expensive operations
    large_list = [i**2 for i in range(1000000)]
    sum(large_list)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use Context Managers for Resources

```python
# Good: Files are automatically closed
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()

# Good: Locks are automatically released
with threading.Lock():
    shared_resource += 1

# Good: Connections are automatically closed
with database.connect() as conn:
    conn.execute(query)
```

### 2. Keep Context Manager Logic Simple

```python
# Good: Simple and focused
@contextmanager
def timing_context():
    start = time.time()
    yield
    end = time.time()
    print(f"Elapsed: {end - start:.2f}s")

# Avoid: Complex logic in context managers
@contextmanager
def complex_context():
    # Too much setup logic
    # Multiple concerns mixed together
    # Hard to test and maintain
    pass
```

### 3. Handle Exceptions Appropriately

```python
@contextmanager
def safe_operation():
    try:
        setup_resources()
        yield
    except SpecificException as e:
        # Handle specific exceptions if needed
        log_error(e)
        raise  # Re-raise unless you want to suppress
    finally:
        cleanup_resources()
```

### 4. Use Type Hints

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager
from typing import Iterator, Optional

@contextmanager
def typed_context() -> Iterator[Optional[str]]:
    try:
        yield "resource"
    finally:
        pass
```

## Conclusion

Context managers are a powerful feature that makes Python code safer and more elegant. They embody the principle of "explicit is better than implicit" by making resource management patterns clear and automatic.

Key takeaways:
- Use `with` statements for all resource management
- Create custom context managers when you have setup/teardown patterns
- Leverage `contextlib` for simple context managers
- Always handle exceptions appropriately
- Keep context manager logic focused and simple

In our next post, we'll explore decorators—another Python feature that promotes clean, reusable code by separating concerns and adding functionality without modifying core logic.
