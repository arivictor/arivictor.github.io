### What I do now

I’m the chief engineer and founder at [**VoltMind**](https://voltmind.ai), where I’m building a DSL-based workflow engine on top of the Temporal Python SDK with plugin-driven task execution. My focus is on reliability, clarity, and code that does exactly what it should—nothing more, nothing less.  

### How I got here

I began working life as an electrician straight out of high school before pivoting into software engineering. Since then, I’ve spent time across industries and geographies:  
- Big 4 banking  
- Big 4 consulting (yes, Accenture counts)  
- Crypto startups in San Francisco  
- Remote work from quiet fishing villages in South East Asia  

Each step has shaped how I think about systems, responsibility, and craft.  

### What I care about

Outside of building workflows and platforms, my interests are straightforward:  
- Code philosophy and patterns  
- Minimalism in tools, design, and life  
- Bouldering and problem-solving on the wall  
- Travel and immersion in different cultures  
- Learning Spanish, one word at a time
