# 👋 Hi there, <br/> I'm Ari.

### I'm a software engineer with a focus on workflows and system design.

### Currently, I'm working with the Temporal Python SDK, building a DSL-based workflow engine with plugin-based task execution.

<br>

Most of my time is spent writing code, refining systems, or thinking about how to make things more reliable with less noise.  
Things I care about:

- ⚙️ Precision in engineering. Code should do exactly what it says, nothing more, nothing less.  
- 📚 Reading, mostly technical work and some philosophy.  
- 🛠 Minimalism in tools and design. No excess, no hype.
